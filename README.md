Boilerplate Styles
===============

Howdy.

This is a three-way boilerplate for styles. 

**LESS**, **SASS**, and then a compiled version of them in standard **CSS**.

Features will include:
- Floatless Grid Layout
- Div-based Divider
- Reasonable Reset
- Float-Left/Right Styles
- 2-Column Layout
- WordPress Compatible Styles
- HTML5/CSS3 Happy Styles
- Implementation of new developer prefix models
- IE 9+ Styles (IE7 is dead and 8 will be soon to follow given current Windows 7/8 adoption rates)
- Awesomesauce
